      "characteristics directly using satellite data to show how healthy plants are in a specific area. \n",
      "•\t Indirect observation of vegetation: These indices rely on several inputs such as remote \n",

      "between near-infrared and red reflectance. Healthy plants reflect more near-infrared light and \n",
      "less red light, providing insights into their density and vigor. The NDVI, an indicator of green \n",

       " '2\\nCENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA\\nAbout this series: The climate crisis is intensifying humanitarian emergencies around the world, requiring \\nhumanitarians to incorporate climate data and forecasts into their analysis and planning. This guidance \\nseries has been developed to help humanitarians to access, analyze and interpret common types of \\nclimate and weather data, and to provide a common language for working with meteorological and \\nhydrological services.\\n•\\t Vegetation indices such as Water Requirement Satisfaction Index, Normalized Difference \\nVegetation Index or Biomass are essential tools for understanding vegetation conditions and \\nhow they evolve over time.\\n•\\t By identifying anomalies, it is possible to understand deviations in vegetation cover for the \\nsame period each year, allowing for the detection of unusual changes, which could impact \\nhumanitarian planning.\\n•\\t Analysis of these indicators should be adapted to the local context taking account of \\ndifferent land cover types or climatic regions. \\n•\\t Vegetation indices can be used to classify vegetation, monitor drought and detect crop \\ndiseases. They provide insight on key questions, including:\\n•\\t How does the current green vegetation compare to normal conditions for the season?\\n•\\t How has vegetation cover changed in recent weeks or months?\\n•\\t Which areas have experienced significant decreases in vegetation cover?\\n•\\t Understanding vegetation conditions through these indices can provide early warnings of \\npotential food insecurity, increase in food prices and environmental stress.\\n•\\t By identifying areas at risk of drought or crop failure, humanitarian organizations can \\nallocate resources more effectively, implement timely interventions and support vulnerable \\ncommunities before a shock escalates.\\nKey takeaways\\nWhat are Vegetation Indices?\\nVegetation indices are valuable tools for assessing the conditions of croplands and rangelands. \\nThey are calculated using remote sensing data, such as satellite imagery and aerial photography, \\nalong with rainfall and temperature measurements and seasonal crop calendars. Vegetation \\nindices can be used to classify vegetation, monitor drought, detect crop diseases and more. \\nVegetation indices can help humanitarians better understand potential crop failures and take \\nproactive measures to prevent food crises. For example, OCHA’s Chad Anticipatory Action \\nDrought Framework1 uses a trigger mechanism that combines seasonal rainfall estimates2 with \\nvegetation indices, providing windows of opportunity to mitigate the impacts of drought.\\n1  Anticipatory Action Framework - Pilot in Chad: Drought\\n2 Climate Guidance Series: Precipitation Forecasts\\n',\n",
       " '3\\nCENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA\\nVegetation indices can be categorized into three groups3:\\n•\\t Direct observation of vegetation: These indices typically detect and measure vegetation \\ncharacteristics directly using satellite data to show how healthy plants are in a specific area. \\n•\\t Indirect observation of vegetation: These indices rely on several inputs such as remote \\nsensing data, weather information, soil moisture levels, and water data to infer the condition \\nof vegetation. \\n•\\t Composite indicators: These indices combine multiple data inputs to create a \\ncomprehensive measure that acts as a proxy for assessing drought severity or evaluating \\ncrop performance throughout the growing season.\\nDirect observations\\nThese indicators are derived directly from observations of vegetation status, primarily through \\nremote sensing data collected via satellites. One example is the Normalized Difference \\nVegetation Index (NDVI), which is calculated using satellite imagery to assess the difference \\nbetween near-infrared and red reflectance. Healthy plants reflect more near-infrared light and \\nless red light, providing insights into their density and vigor. The NDVI, an indicator of green \\nvegetation density, is widely used in agriculture to monitor crop health. It can also highlight \\nchanges in vegetation cover, signaling potential wildfires, the spread of diseases affecting \\nvegetation or other environmental changes.\\nIndirect observations\\nThese indices typically combine several data sources that are not directly tied to the condition \\nof vegetation or crops but relate to broader aspects of vegetation health, such as temperature \\nand rainfall. For example, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) assesses rainfall deficit or \\nexcess compared to seasonal averages, while the Water Requirement Satisfaction Index (WRSI) \\nevaluates the extent to which water needs for specific crops are being met during the rainy \\nseason. \\nIn this guide, we focus on WRSI as an example of an index that uses indirect observation, \\ncalculated using meteorological data collected from weather stations and satellite-based \\nprecipitation estimates. These data sources provide essential information on temperature, \\nhumidity, and solar radiation, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of whether crop water \\nrequirements are being met and helping to identify areas at risk of water stress.\\nWRSI is tailored to the water needs of a specific crop, considering both water supply and crop \\nwater demands. Typically, WRSI is computed as a cumulative value starting at the beginning of \\nthe season, with values calculated at 10-day intervals (referred to as dekads) throughout the \\nseason. WRSI can provide insights into expected crop yield. \\nComposite indicators \\nComposite indicators combine various data sources, including satellite-derived indicators, \\nrainfall, seasonal crop calendars and other regional or crop-specific inputs. In this guide, we \\nfocus on Biomass, one of the most used composite indicators in the humanitarian sector \\nas it provides a measure of agricultural productivity, which is closely linked to food security \\nand food prices. This makes it a valuable tool for anticipating food shortages and guiding \\nhumanitarian responses.\\nTypes of Vegetation Indices and their computation\\n3 The categories are adapted from WMO’s Handbook of Drought Indicators and Indices.\\n',\n",
       " '4\\nCENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA\\nBiomass is defined as the amount of vegetation within a given area and is related to the \\nexpected yield, vegetation density and health. Biomass values are typically calculated using \\ndifferent inputs, such as vegetation weight, height and vegetation cover from other indices \\nsuch as NDVI. The amount of agricultural production harvested per unit of land area, referred \\nto as the yield, is strongly correlated with Biomass.\\nWhat do the values mean?\\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index\\nNDVI values range from -1 to 1. Positive NDVI values greater than 0.5 indicate the presence \\nof healthy, green vegetation. The highest possible density of green vegetation corresponds to \\nan NDVI close to +1. An NDVI value of zero suggests the absence of green vegetation, possibly \\nindicating barren soil. Negative values are typically associated with non-vegetative land cover, \\nsuch as bodies of water or urban areas.\\nExample of NDVI, WRSI and Biomass data for Niger in August 2022 when the OCHA anticipatory action4 framework was activated.\\nLand Cover\\nNDVI values\\nWater surfaces, man-made structures, rocks, clouds, snow\\n-1 to 0 exclusively\\nBarren soil\\nBetween 0 and 0.1\\nSparse vegetation\\nBetween 0.2 and 0.5\\nDense vegetation\\nBetween 0.6 and 1\\nVegetation conditions can change rapidly. As such, averaging NDVI values over a given time \\nspan can provide a more comprehensive view of the vegetation’s state. \\nNDVI anomalies indicate deviations from average conditions. They are calculated by comparing \\ncurrent NDVI values to the long-term average for the same time period, which typically spans \\nfive to twenty years. Positive NDVI anomalies suggest healthier-than-average vegetation \\nconditions, while negative anomalies indicate suboptimal state of vegetation health compared \\nto the long-term average.\\n4 https://www.unocha.org/publications/report/niger/impact-story-breaking-cycle-negative-coping-strategies-lessons-anticipatory-action-niger-2022\\nNDVI\\nWRSI\\nBiomass\\n',\n",
       " '5\\nCENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA\\nWater Requirement Satisfaction Index\\nCrop water requirements vary throughout a crop’s growth cycle; these changing needs \\nare quantified using crop coefficients. Each crop type has its unique set of coefficients that \\nestimate water use during different growth stages. These coefficients represent the ratio \\nbetween water needs and potential water evaporation and transpiration, also referred to as \\nevapotranspiration, which is typically determined by the crop’s growing environment. Crops in \\nhot, dry climates have a higher potential evaporation rate compared to those in cooler, more \\nhumid climates. \\nWRSI values are calculated cumulatively over time and usually correspond with the different \\ngrowth stages between the estimated start and end of the season. The index values range from \\n0 to 100. A value of 100 indicates that the crop’s water requirements are fully satisfied, while \\nlower values suggest varying degrees of water stress, whereby the crop’s water requirements \\ncannot be satisfied. A WRSI value of 0 is assigned for seasons with no rainfall or other water \\nsources. WRSI serves as a measure of how effectively a particular crop’s water demands are \\nbeing met throughout its growth cycle.\\nInstead of relying on a single crop coefficient in areas with multiple crops, the weighted \\naverage of crop coefficients should be used to adjust the water requirements. WRSI can be \\nused for both rainfed crops and pasture. For pasture, the crop coefficient for forages or grass \\nis used to adjust the water requirements. There is no need to use WRSI outside of a crop’s \\ngrowing season. \\nWRSI values are typically available with high spatial granularity, allowing for aggregation of \\ndata at small administrative divisions, such as admin level three or below. This enables a more \\ndetailed and localized analysis of water availability, facilitating a comprehensive understanding \\nof its impact on crop performance in specific geographic regions. \\nBiomass \\nBiomass is commonly measured as units of mass per unit area, such as kilograms per hectare \\n(kg/ha), megagrams per hectare (Mg/ha), or tons per acre. The calculation process often \\ninvolves field measurements, remote sensing data, and statistical models. Field measurements \\nmight include direct sampling of plant material, while remote sensing data can provide large-\\nscale vegetation cover and health information. Statistical models integrate these inputs to \\nestimate the total Biomass. \\nInterpreting Biomass data can be challenging due to the variability in Biomass values for \\ndifferent types of vegetation and regions. Factors such as species composition, vegetation age, \\nand local environmental conditions can significantly influence Biomass measurements. \\nTo address these challenges, Biomass anomalies compare a season’s Biomass values to \\nhistorical Biomass production. These anomalies help quantify variations in vegetation health \\nand are typically expressed as a percentage of the average Biomass or as a percentage \\ndifference from the average. By analyzing Biomass anomalies, it is possible to identify trends, \\nassess the impact of environmental changes, and make informed decisions about land use and \\nconservation efforts.\\n< 50\\n50 - 59\\n60 - 79\\n80 - 94\\n95 - 99\\n100\\nCrop Failure\\nSevere Deficit\\nModerate Deficit\\nAverage/Mild Deficit\\nGood\\nVery Good\\n',\n",

       " '7\\nCENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA\\nCommon limitations with Vegetation Indices  \\nSeveral factors should be considered when interpreting vegetation indices, including: \\n•\\t Satellite-based rainfall estimates may have a degree of error due to biases in satellite \\nsensors, persistent and thick cloud cover, or for pixels at the edges of the extent of the data \\nsource. These errors can cause inaccuracies with the rainfall inputs, and, consequently, \\ncompromise the results of the crop models and the balance of evapotranspiration. To \\nmitigate these issues, use satellite rainfall data that integrates ground-based observations and \\ncomprehensively covers the region of interest. \\n•\\t NDVI values indicate the greenness of vegetation. Areas with greener vegetation typically \\nshow higher NDVI values compared to areas with healthy vegetation that is less green. \\nFurthermore, variations in agricultural practices and crop types can affect the greenness of \\nvegetation. As such, it is crucial to consider the crop types present in a region or to use NDVI \\nanomalies for more accurate comparisons.\\n•\\t In areas with limited vegetation cover, certain soil types, such as sandy soils, have high \\nreflection rates that can interfere with the values of vegetation indices. This high reflectance \\naffects the spectral bands that vegetation indices calculations rely on, leading to inaccuracies \\nin assessing vegetation greenness. In these situations, additional validation, such as field \\nmeasurements or cross-validation with other remote sensing data, is required to ensure \\naccuracy.\\n•\\t Averaging values over large areas can obscure important details, such as the presence of \\nmicro-climates or localized destruction of vegetation.\\n•\\t Biomass estimation relies on assumptions about vegetation that may not be applicable to \\nthe same vegetation in a different region. Therefore, estimates should always be used and \\nvalidated within a local context.\\n',\n",
       " '8\\nCENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA\\nCommon errors and misconceptions\\n•\\t The initial stages or dekads of each rainy season vary slightly depending on the onset of the \\nrains. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the crop growth stages, consider \\nground data on planting dates.\\n•\\t It is important to verify the use of correct crop coefficients for WRSI calculations. Each crop \\nand climatic region has specific coefficients that can be used to adjust the specific climatic and \\ncrop conditions. \\n•\\t In areas with only rainfed crops, the WRSI can be computed through the use of satellite \\nprecipitation datasets to estimate the evapotranspiration rates. However, for areas with both \\nrainfed crops and irrigated crops, it is necessary to do additional monitoring of irrigation \\nwater usage and reassess actual evapotranspiration rates.\\n•\\t NDVI has a strong correlation with Biomass, as plants produce Biomass through \\nphotosynthesis. Greater vegetation greenness indicates higher Biomass. However, at high \\nBiomass levels, NDVI becomes saturated, meaning values do not change significantly past a \\ncertain level of vegetation cover. For areas with permanently dense vegetation, consider using \\nother vegetation indices such as Enhanced Vegetation Index or Normalised Difference Red \\nEdge.\\n•\\t While Biomass and yield are strongly correlated, they are not equivalent.
